# HHJMs
H-likelihood based Hierarchical Joint Models

### Description

This package fits shared parameter models for the joint modeling of longitudinal data and survival data, where the longitudinal responses may be of mixed types, such as binary and continuous, and may be left censored by lower limit of quantification. For statistical inference, we consider a computationally efficient approximate likelihood method based on h-likelihood method [1]. Essentially, the h-likelihood method uses Laplace approximations to the intractable integral in the likelihood. Moreover, it can produce approximate MLEs for the mean parameters and approximate restricted maximum likelihood estimates (REML) for the variance-covariance (dispersion) parameters.
